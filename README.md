# Website with KTM motorcycle models (React)

It is a SPA website featuring KTM motorcycle models, descriptions, and a simple order form.

Stack and what I did: Written in React. Used React Route v6 library for navigation. Created product card components, etc. Used Google's Firebase and their Realtime Database to store the database. Used Axios for sending queries. Used Redux state manager. Configured a form to send to the server. Revamped it from Redux to Redux Toolkit with the Thunk library embedded so that it could work better with asynchronous requests. In a separate branch, I used Styled Components for styles. In the main style branch, I use CSS modules. For validating the submission form, I used React Hook Form. Wrote tests on Jest. Nearly 40 unit tests for components, asynchronous code, integration tests for pages with components, on Routing, Redux, and Selector for Redux. Snapshot tests for simple components. E2E tests for sending the form to the server used webdriverIO. With Cypress tests on link navigation, form validation, and form submission. Used Storybook to create a visual library of components with their descriptions for reuse. Added type to the TypeScript project, prescribed types.
